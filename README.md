‚ú® What It Does:

  Intelligent Analysis: This tool does more than just count characters. It provides smart feedback by spotting common passwords, predictable keyboard patterns (like qwerty), and sequential numbers or letters (like 123 or abc).

  Secure Generator: It includes a powerful password generator that uses the browser's own cryptographic tools to create truly random and strong passwords.

  Private Breach Checking: It securely checks if your password has appeared in a data breach using the 'Have I Been Pwned' service, without ever sending your actual password over the internet.

  100% Private and Serverless: Everything runs directly on your machine. Nothing you type is ever saved, stored, or sent anywhere, ensuring complete privacy.

üõ†Ô∏è Built With:

  This tool is built with standard web technologies, keeping it lightweight and fast. The main components are HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+), with Tailwind CSS for styling and Font Awesome for icons.
